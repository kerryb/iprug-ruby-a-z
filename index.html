        <p>This is a lightning talk I gave at <a
            href="http://iprug.org">IPRUG</a>.  It works best in Chrome or
          Safari.</p>
        <p>Navigate using cursor keys, space bar or carriage return. Jump to a
          specific slide by pressing its letter.</p>

      <div id="notes-1">
        <p>A is for <a href="http://as.rubyonrails.org/">ActiveSupport</a>, the
          Rails utility gem that provides all the little niceties from
          <tt>blank?</tt> to <tt>3.days.from.now.at_beginning_of_day</tt>.</p>
        <p>Of course you don&rsquo;t have to only use it in Rails projects, and
          nowadays it&rsquo;s quite modular so you can just require the bits you
          want.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-2">
        <p>B is for
          <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_containers.html#S2">blocks</a>,
          which are one of Ruby&rsquo;s most powerful features. Amongst other
          things, they let you iterate over collections without risking
          off-by-one errors, and work with files without having to remember to
          explicitly close them afterwards.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-3">
        <p>C is for community and culture. I&rsquo;ve always found the Ruby
          community to be pretty friendly and helpful, and it&rsquo;s as much a
          part of the attraction as the langauge itself.</p>
        <p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the occasional bit of conflict and
          <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/9333ca7...23aa7da">controversy</a>
          to add some excitement!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-4">
        <p>D is for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typing</a>,
          which frees us from a lot of the boilerplate that you need in
          some languages, and doesn&rsquo;t lead to anywhere near as many
          errors as people used to static typing expect.</p>
        <p>And, just for
          <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/humblefrog/asset-pipeline-8763166">Steve</a>,
          D is also for <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">DHH</a>
          &ndash; love him or hate him, by creating Rails he&rsquo;s probably done
          more than most to boost the popularity of Ruby.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-5">
        <p>E is for <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a>,
          the module that gives you nearly 50 collection methods for the price
          of one &ndash; you just need to define <tt>each</tt> and it does the rest.</p>
        <p>Some of Enumerable&rsquo;s methods, like <tt>map</tt>,
          <tt>reduce</tt> and <tt>select</tt> are also critical to our next
          entry &hellip;</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-6">
        <p>F is for Functional programming, which for an object-oriented
          scripting language Ruby supports surprisingly well.
          You can&rsquo;t really enforce immutability (there&rsquo;s <tt>freeze</tt>, but
          that only does half a job), but <tt>Enumerable</tt> and blocks
          combine to give us what has been described as &lsquo;an acceptable
          lisp&rsquo;.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-7">
        <p>G is for gems &ndash; over 33,000 so far and counting. <a
            href="http://rubygems.org/">Rubygems</a> might not be the perfect
          package management system, but it&rsquo;s not bad (especially if you throw
          <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> into the mix)</p>
        <p>Despite what tools like <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/hoe">hoe</a>
          would have you believe, creating a gem is
          <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">incredibly easy</a>,
          and since
          <a href="http://update.gemcutter.org/2009/10/26/transition.html">GemCutter took over rubygems.org</a>,
          publishing them is trivial too.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-8">
        <p>H is for happiness. Matz has said that the primary purpose of Ruby
          is to &ldquo;help every programmer in the world to be productive, and
          to enjoy programming, and to be happy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, DHH describes Rails as &ldquo;optimized for
          programmer happiness&rdquo;.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-9">
        <p>I is for <a
            href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/irb.html">irb</a>
          (or better still, <a href="http://pry.github.com/">pry</a>), where
          you can try things out and see isntant results. When I first started
          using Ruby this was a breath of fresh air, although it turns out that
          most modern languages have a similar
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>. I say
          &lsquo;most&rsquo; advisedly, because &hellip;</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-10">
        <p>J is for <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, the language
          rubyists love to hate. It actually turns out to be a rather clunky
          language running on a very solid platform. Fortunately we have
          <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, which lets us take advantage
          of one without having to put up with the other.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-11">
        <p>K is for kitten. Nothing to do with Ruby, but every presentation
          should have one.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-12">
        <p>L is for licence. Ruby is released under the permissive <a
            href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT licence</a>,
          and most libraries and tools seem to follow suit, or use some other
          BSD-like licence.</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s just the path of least
          resistance or whether rubyists care more about sharing their work
          than forcing others to do the same, but I can&rsquo;t remember the
          last time I saw a piece of Ruby code with a GPL licence attached.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-13">
        <p>M is for magic. Whether it&rsquo;s metaprogramming, method missing,
          monkey-patching or mixing in modules, Ruby gives us a lot of tools
          that let us implement &lsquo;clever&rsquo; solutions. To quote Mrs
          Weasley though, &ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re allowed to use magic now
          does <em>not</em> mean you have to whip your wands out for
          <em>everything</em>!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>And, of course, M is also for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a>,
          who started it all.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-14">
        <p>N is for nil, and the kind of thing that happens when you let your
          methods return it.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-15">
        <p>O is for open source, which seems to be very much part of the Ruby philosophy.</p>
        <p>It's also for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Open_classes">open classes</a>,
          but, as with metaprogramming, just because you <em>can</em> add
          methods to an existing class, it doesn't necessarily mean you
          <em>should</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-16">
        <p>P is for pernicketiness and perfectionism (and just a little bit of
          pedantry). Your code might work, but does that mean it&rsquo;s finished?
          Have you remembered the third step in &lsquo;red, green,
          refactor&rsquo; and cleaned up the design so it&rsquo;ll also be easy to
          maintain in the future?</p>
        <p>Of course, perfectionism needs to be tempered with a healthy dose of
          pragmatism. Just don&rsquo;t use it as an excuse for letting your standards
          slip!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-17">
        <p>Q is for the <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a>.
          Unfortunately even its
          <a href="http://rubyquiz.strd6.com/about">latest incarnation</a>
          seems to have dried up, but there are still a couple of hundred
          entries in the archive, which make excellent practice problems or
          katas.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-18">
        <p>R is for <a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/rake">Rake</a>,
          <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>,
          <a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a>,
          <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and
          <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> That&rsquo;s a fairly random
          collection of libraries and frameworks which just happen to start
          with R, but they&rsquo;re really here as a reminder of how many great
          tools we have at our disposal.</p>
        <p>Of course, no-one can remember them all, so
          <a href="http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">The Ruby Toolbox</a> is a good
          place to find the right tool for the job.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-19">
        <p>S is for the
          <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/">Standard Library</a>.
          Often overlooked, but home to all manner of useful classes and
          modules.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-20">
        <p>T is for testing in general, and TDD in particular. Without a
          compiler to catch silly mistakes, automated tests become even more
          important (although, of course, TDD is about design rather than
          testing).</p>
        <p>An admission though: I didn't test-drive the Javascript behind this
          presentation, and it probably shows!</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-21">
        <p>U is for &rdquo;Use the source, Luke!&rdquo; &ndash; something that&rsquo;s
          much easier to do in an interpreted language like Ruby, which can
          come in handy for some libraries with less-than-comprehensive
          documentation.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-22">
        <p>V is for <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. Not really
          Ruby-specific, but enjoying something of a resurgence as the cool
          rubyist&rsquo;s editor of choice.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-23">
        <p>W is for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">Why the Lucky Stiff</a>,
          prolific author of Ruby libraries and of course of the unique
          <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">Poignant Guide</a>.
          He may have moved on, but you can still see his influence in the
          lighter side of the Ruby community.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-24">
        <p>X is for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>.
          Fortunately there&rsquo;s nowhere near as much of it about as there
          is with some other languages, but when we do need to deal with it we
          have great libraries like
          <a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org/">Builder</a> and
          <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> to help.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-25">
        <p>Y is for young programmers. The mainstream world seems to have
          finally started to notice the sorry state of computer studies in
          schools, and Ruby (with a bit of help from projects like
          <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety-Hack</a> and
          <a href="http://kidsruby.com/">KidsRuby</a>) seems as good a language
          as any for the next generation to start with.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="notes-26">
        <p>Z is for zero. Some facts about zero in ruby: it&rsquo;s not false,
          and dividing a floating point by it gives the constant
          <tt>Infinity</tt>, not an error. Most importantly though, zero is the
          number of slides I have left.</p>
